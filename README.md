## Set up instructions
### 1) Install python on your machine
- I recommend using Anaconda distribution that can be downloaded from **https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution**
### 2) Download the project
- save the entire project folder on your machine, e.g. `"C:\project"`
### 3) Intall the required python modules
- using the command prompt, set current the working directory to the project's folder using `"cd C:\project"`
- then run `"pip install -r requirements.txt"` command - this will install all python modules that are required for this project, as listed in the "requirements.txt" text file
### 4) Run the data prep python script ("prep.py")
- this script creates a SQL database, tables, inserts the data from CSV files in "data" folder into the database and manipulates the data so that it can be presented in the dashboard - therefore, it is vital that this is run prior to instantiating the actual dashboard
- run the script from the command line using the example below. Adjust the example to point to wherever python is installed on your machine and to the wherever the script is located. Example below assumes Python is a part of Anaconda distribution 
- `"C:\Users\David\anaconda3\python.exe" "C:\project\prep.py"`
### 5) Make sure python is installed on your machine
