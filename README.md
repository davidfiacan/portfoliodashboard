## Set up instructions
### 1) Install python on your machine
- I recommend using Anaconda distribution that can be downloaded from **https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution**
### 2) Download the project
- save the entire project folder on your machine, e.g. `"C:\tradingdashboard"`
### 3) Intall the required python modules
- using the command prompt, set current the working directory to the project's folder using `"cd C:\tradingdashboard"`
- then run `"pip install -r requirements.txt"` command - this will install all python modules that are required for this project, as listed in the "requirements.txt" text file
### 4) Run the data prep python script ("prep.py")
- this script creates SQL database, tables, reads data from CSV files provided ("C:\tradingdashboard\data"), manipulates the data and inserts it into database, ready to be visualised & analysed from within the dashboard. It is vital that this procedure is run prior to instantiating the actual dashboard
- run the script from the command line using the example below - adjust the current directory accordingly if using different directory for the project
- `"cd C:\tradingdashboard"`
- `"python prep.py"`
### 5) Make sure python is installed on your machine
