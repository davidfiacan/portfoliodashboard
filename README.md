## Set up instructions
### 1) Install python on your machine
### 2) Download the project
### 3) Intall the required python modules
- using the command prompt, set current working directory to wherever the project's folder is located, e.g. "cd C:\projectfolder"
- then run ###"pip install -r requirements.txt"
- this will install all python modules that are required for this project, as listed in the "requirements.txt" text file
### 4) Run the data prep python script
- this script ("prep.py") creates a SQL database, tables, inserts the data from CSV files in "data" folder into the database and manipulates the data so that it can be presented in the dashboard - therefore, it is vital that this is run prior to instantiating the actual dashboard
- run "prep.py" script using python from the command line. Example command below needs to be changed  
- "C:\Users\drbon\anaconda3\python.exe" "C:\Users\drbon\OneDrive\_trading_new\python\workings\projects\tl_sql\streamlit app\prep.py"
### 5) Make sure python is installed on your machine
